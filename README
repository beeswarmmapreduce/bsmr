How to get a multi-firefox setup to use the cluster.

List of cluster computers:
 http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jjaakkol/hpc-report.txt

Always check that list and find a free one

Dependencies: 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 a. You must have X11 running on your client. 
    Use a CS department Linux box if you get issues.

 b. Install the Linux version of FireFox 4 beta in your FS home dir.
    This README assumes it's available at ~/firefox/

 c. Have a checkout of bsmr in your FS home dir.
    This README assumes it's available at ~/bsmr

    If this checkout is not done by eclipse, use the compile-server.sh script
    to compile the classes.

Install procedure:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Log on to a cluster (any one of them is good):
    ssh -X ukko[XXX].hpc.cs.helsinki.fi

2. Start the profile manager:
    ~/firefox/firefox -no-remote -ProfileManager

3. Create N profiles called BSMR#t where t is 1..N

4. Install the BS extension on each profile (replace N)
    ~/bsmr/bsmr-browsers.sh ~/firefox/firefox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/242722/ N
  (the script finishes when all browsers are closed)

How to use:
^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Use screen or log in twice to the server (remember ssh -X). 

VTa: cd ~/bsmr/ && ./server.sh

VTb: ./bsmr-browsers.sh ~/firefox/firefox ~/bsmr-test/worker/index.html 2
   (use the last parameter to say how many clients to start)
