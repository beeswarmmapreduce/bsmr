To run the system you need to

1) install master dependencies with detdeps.sh
The Jetty versions are constantly changing so you might need to change the version number, and fix a few things here or there

2) use compile-server script to compile the server

3) navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (where 127.0.0.1 is the machine ip address) for a greeter

to start nodes on a headless server you may use...

xvfb-run google-chrome "http://127.0.0.1:8080/worker/sandbox.html?master=127.0.0.1:8080"
