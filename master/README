You need Jetty (developed with version 8.0.0.M1). To retrieve & untar, you can try getdeps.sh. Otherwise download it manually and make sure the jetty is available as master/jetty-distribution-8.0.0.M1

Note! The eclipse project file refers to this directory and the libraries contain the version number of eclipse. So if you use a different version of jetty, you need to configure the eclipse build path (right click the project, Build Path->Configure Build Path, libraries tab).
