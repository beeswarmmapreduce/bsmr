== Dependencies ==

You need Jetty (developed with version 8.0.0.M1). To retrieve & untar, you can
try getdeps.sh. Otherwise download it manually and make sure the jetty is 
available as master/jetty-distribution-8.0.0.M1

Note! The Eclipse project file refers to this directory and the libraries 
contain the version number of Eclipse. So if you use a different version of 
jetty, you need to configure the Eclipse build path (right click the project,
Build Path->Configure Build Path, libraries tab).

== Compiling ==

In Eclipse, it's automatic. Otherwise, compile the classes using all libraries
in jetty-../lib in the class path.

== Running ==

In Eclipse, right click the StartJetty class in master/src, then Run As -> Java
Application After you've ran it once, you can find it in the "play" button 
located on the Eclipse toolbar.

Without eclipse, use the same classpath as for compiling and give StartJetty as
the main class.
