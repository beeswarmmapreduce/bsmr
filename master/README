== Quick start ==

Run ./server.sh in the project root directory to build and start the
BSMR master server.

== Compiling ==

From the command line in the master/ directory: mvn install

In Eclipse, it's automatic. You should make sure you have the m2e plugin
installed though. It integrates maven with eclipse and makes your life
much easier.

You can also use the server.sh in the project root. It runs mvn install
and then runs the test server.

== Dependencies ==

Maven takes care of downloading the appropriate dependencies.

== Javadoc ==

To get spiffy documentation of the BSMR master classes, run "mvn install".
That will create HTML javadoc in the master/target/apidocs directory.

== Running ==

From the command line, you can use ./serve.rsh in the project root directory.

In Eclipse, right click the StartJetty class in master/src/test/java, then 
Run As -> Java

Application After you've ran it once, you can find it in the "play" button 
located on the Eclipse toolbar.

Without eclipse, use the same classpath as for compiling and give StartJetty as
the main class.
