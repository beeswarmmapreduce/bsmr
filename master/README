== Dependencies ==

You need Jetty (developed with version 8.0.0.M2, and later ported to use
8.0.1.v20110908). To retrieve & untar, you can try getdeps.sh. Otherwise
download it manually and make sure the jetty is available as
master/jetty-distribution-8.0.1.v20110908

Note! The Eclipse project file refers to this directory and the libraries 
contain the version number of Eclipse. So if you use a different version of 
jetty, you need to configure the Eclipse build path (right click the project,
Build Path->Configure Build Path, libraries tab).

== Compiling ==

In Eclipse, it's automatic. Otherwise, compile the classes using all libraries
in jetty-../lib in the class path.

You can also use the compile-server.sh in the project root, or the ant script.

== Javadoc ==

To get spiffy documentation of the BSMR master classes, run "ant" at the project
root. That will create HTML javadoc in the master/doc directory.

== Running ==

In Eclipse, right click the StartJetty class in master/src, then Run As -> Java
Application After you've ran it once, you can find it in the "play" button 
located on the Eclipse toolbar.

Without eclipse, use the same classpath as for compiling and give StartJetty as
the main class.
