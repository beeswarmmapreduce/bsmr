	<h1>Bee Swarm MapReduce</h1>	
	<p>Welcome to Bee Swarm MapReduce demo.
	The server runs three different services &mdash; Master, Static, and PetriFS.
	Master is the key component that keeps of ongoing jobs.
	Static is an old fashioned web server that is used to serve the worker and console for
	demonstration purposes. PetriFS is a simple http-based file system that we use in the
	examples. 
	</p>
	<h2>Example Use</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Install and run Google Chrome (known to work)</li>
		<li>Go to the <a href="/static/console">console</a> in one tab</li>
		<li>Notice that the worker list at the bottom is empty</li>
		<li>Open the <a href="/static/exampleapp/app.html">example application</a> in another tab</li>
		<li>Go back to the console tab</li>
		<li>Witness one worker appear in the worker list</li>
		<li>Add a job from the console</li>
		<li>Navigate to the new job within the console</li>
		<li>Monitor job progress in the console</li>
		<li>Watch results appear in the data <a href="/static/data">folder</a></li>
	</ol>
	<p> You may wish to run a worker node
	<a href="/static/worker/sandbox.html?master=127.0.0.1:8080">separately</a>
	to debug its behavior.
	</p>

	<h2>Security Limitations</h2>
	<p>
	In a real use scenario one should disable http access to the server entirely,
	and only allow WebSocket connections to the worker interface. Master also
	provides a console interface over the same WebSocket interface. It may be
	desirable to limit access to the console interface as well. Keep in mind
	that BSMR is a mere research prototype, and even if these measures are
	taken some loop holes will remain.
